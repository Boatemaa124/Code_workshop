    <p>My coding experience has been really great and requires a lot of work with persistence. It has has been stressful and very frustrating. 
Asked a couple of friends for help when i got stuck at certain points. Hosting a website was quite tough but i pulled though.
As time goes on and with me encoutering different situations, learning from it and find soultions to it has been a fun experience.
Freecodecamp has also helped in a great way, by teaching step by step and with all the patience. 
Now i guess i'm getting btter and familiar with some programming launguages.
Having the freecodecamp streaks has kept me on my toes, with all the motivational quotes to make it more encouraging.
It has been fascinating to me because there's no pressure and i'm learning at my own pace.<br>

   <h2>My Journey with Freecodecamp</h2>
Freecodecamp has become one of the platforms I use in my Computer Science study.
This platform is a web developing platform which helps students or individuals who are interested in Web Development.
Freecodecamp was introduced to me by a lecturer who is taking me in L200 in our second or third online class if i could remember.  
The Lecturer really has ample time for all his students, because he takes his time to teach us and if we dont get anything he's ready
to teach us to make us understand, which is very impressive.<br />
